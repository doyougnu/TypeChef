* Figuring out the sat interface
** Frontend
*** isSatisfiable method called from featureexpr.FeatureExpr
** FeatureExpr
** Solver Interface
*** in "featureexpr/sat/SatSolver"

*** Important Question to answer

     - [ ] find out when the caching is done; is it done before or after queries?

       - [ ] we know caching is hit before an ~isSat~ call, but we don't know if
         caching is hit before or after queries

     - [ ] As a baseline, how is TypeChef handling the feature model? What is the
       interface to the solver here, is the FM added only once and then
       incremental solving occurs for subsequent queries

     - [ ] Which of the queries come from the parsing and which from the type checking?

     - [ ] Are there any advantages in doing the Parsing, Type Checking, and data
       flow analysis at the same time

**** Caching hit notes
     - Note taken on [2020-09-17 Thu 21:58] \\
       We found the connection to Sat4j in
       /store/Research/TypeChef/FeatureExprLib/src/main/scala/de/fosd/typechef/featureexpr/sat line 180
       we have annotated important lines with ~[VSAT]~
